An assignment to create a basic library database program using sorted and unsorted lists.

Most of the files were provided as book source code or by the instructor. The majority of the work done was on Main.cpp and Library.cpp.

Sticking to the provided code was rather limiting and made for some awkward implementation. I'd have preferred to use some different solutions in several places.
Current code is just beyond what I would consider first minimum viable product material. I'd like to clean it up and potentially completely re-work the implementation at some point.
